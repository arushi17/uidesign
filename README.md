This README outlines how to run our code. 
- We include several html files as well as png images. The pngs are necessary to form the map element of our screens.
- We chose to use screenshots/images of maps, as we were building static pages without any real backend implementation.
- The pngs, specifically 1) child safe, 2) neutral zone map, 3) safe zone map, and 4) unsafe zone map have been resized using the
preview file adjust size feature (to 75%). 
- The remaining pngs, i.e. 1) unsafe zone (to 65%) and 2) new unsafe zone (to 60%). 
- Any remaining pngs are sourced from the Internet and can be accessed by any computer.

To run and view the html files, all of the files from the github must be downloaded to the same folder on a local desktop. Then, they should be easily viewable.


Overview of code implementation:
We discussed doing HTML/CSS mockups of several prominent screens from our application. We included the main neutral, safe, and unsafe zones
for parents, and neutral and safe for children. Additionally, we mocked the help options and alerts pages for the parent, which are very
similar to what the child's ones would look like. Finally, we mocked a few basic screens on how to add unsafe zones. The basic purpose of this
code implementation was to get experience building static HTML versions of our Figma screens. As a note: the CSS is a bit messy in that it is a
mix of internal and in-line, but we found that this was the only way we could get our mockups working under a time constraint.
